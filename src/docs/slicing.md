# Slicing

Slicing is how you turn a model you downloaded into a file your 3D printer can print.

## STL Files

When you go online to find things to print, they will usually download as `.STL` or  `.3MF` files. 

STL files are basically a bunch of triangles that describe how an object looks:

To print these models, they must first be converted into something your 3D printer can use. 

## Slicer Software

A slicer is a program that converts STL files into GCODE files, which your 3D printer can use.

After it's been converted to a GCODE file, you can copy that file to your 3D printer and it will be able to print it.

## What to use

The two main slicers people use are:

- [Cura](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura)
- [PrusaSlicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424/)

Either one will work, however Cura supports more printers.
